I also really enjoy simplifying naturally complex topics by using the powerful tool of storytelling. Over time, this has become a core part of who I am as a professional and how I think.

<h2>A bit of myself</h2>
<p>I am a child of the new millennium, and for as long as I can remember, my greatest passion has been the world of technology. While other kids spent their weekends at the stationery shop buying the latest issue of their favorite comic book, I was there picking up the latest edition of WinMagazine.</p>
<p>I turned this passion into a profession almost immediately. After graduating from high school, I started working as a software engineer at a small software house in the metropolitan area of Brescia. I began with small tasks: some Java development, a bit of testing support, and occasionally getting my hands dirty with the servers when needed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was love at first sight with programming. The idea of solving complex problems just by pressing a few keys on the keyboard (and occasionally swearing, of course) was nothing short of exhilarating.</p>
<p>For two years, I kept developing, learning, and diving deeper into product dynamics, until my career took a significant turn. I transitioned from being a software engineer to becoming the product manager for the very product I had been working on. From one day to the next, I went from being the one getting hands-on to the one responsible for maximizing the value created by those who now got their hands dirty in my place.</p>
<p>It was a whole new world, one that opened doors to unfamiliar horizons: people and effective communication. I realized that the true strength of this industry lies in its people. One of the most crucial qualities for any "software craftsman" (and I’m not just talking about developers) is the ability to share knowledge and absorb what others share.</p>
<p>And here we are. Four years later, my role now has a strong focus on just that—conferences, social media, publications, and of course, this blog!</p>
<p>To know more about me read <a href="/about">this page</a>, enjoy it!</p>
<h2>What this blog is intended to be</h2>
<p>This blog is created with the intention of being an open window into my content.</p>
<p>From here, anyone eager to dive into some good, solid cloud-native development will find plenty to sink their teeth into through articles, reflections, talks, and much more.</p>
