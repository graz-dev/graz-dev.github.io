One of the most challenging aspects about green software is understanding where to start. Before delving into more complex things, a good starting point is to raise awareness of the hidden â€˜zombiesâ€™ within our infrastructure and then proceed to eliminate them. In this session, weâ€™ll explore what green software is, its environmental and economic implications and how kube-green (an open source project listed in the CNCF landscape) immediately help us make our cloud infrastructures more sustainable.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkoKj52u0sxjWSz5Bl2oXw9Yxl6OpeRh/view?usp=drive_link"},{"event_name":"Conf42 Platform Engineering","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/digital-platform-builders/events/","place":"ðŸ›œ Online","date":"2024-09-05","date_label":"September 05, 2024","talk_title":"Platform Engineering untold truths: is it just an infrastructure matter?","description":"The increasing complexity of software development presents significant risks and inefficiencies, especially for large enterprises.

In the traditional policy enforcement model, manual management leaves organizations vulnerable to inevitable breaches due to human error â€“ a matter of 'when,' not 'if.' Enter Policy-as-Code (PaC), a game-changing approach that leverages code to define and manage policies, transforming rules and conditions into actionable directives. By keeping policy definitions in source code control, whenever a change is made, it can be tested, validated, and then executed. The goal of PaC is not to detect policy violations but to prevent them. In this session we delve into the practical implementation of a Policy-as-Code strategy for your organization using RÃ¶nd and Open Policy Agent, two powerful open-source projects that could help you to redefine your security paradigm.","url":"https://youtu.be/zcWF3EYGlRM?si=BdMU8_rzFcATopvB","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjxHmHjTXkeY8gwbQAAJ1gaz1us2q2wX/view?usp=sharing"}]},"schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage","name":"Speaking Engagements - Graziano Casto","description":"Explore speaking engagements and talks by Graziano Casto","url":"https://grazianocasto.com/speaking"}},"__N_SSG":true}
