The energy and dedication of this community is humbling. Huge thanks to Kubernetes SIGDocs for the unexpected recognition. Helping maintain the Kubernetes Blog is a privilege, and it’s rewarding to support authors in sharing their work. Special shout-out to Tim Bannister for bringing me aboard the blog project! Thanks for the trust, everyone. Let's keep making things better, together. (And a huge thanks to William Rizzo for snapping this shot! I was caught in deep conversation right outside the room during this moment, so I owe him for capturing my recognition - I clearly almost missed my own celebration 😅)","image":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQHaIS2aSaT-bw/feedshare-shrink_800/B4DZpwiP2qKIAg-/0/1762824618279?e=1764806400&v=beta&t=jOOsxn4hcyVMsDypLsurzH44LrIVRSkG6Dhr6ZK3WWk","video":""}]},"schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Blog","name":"Journal - Graziano Casto","description":"A collection of quick thoughts, reflections, and moments","url":"https://castograziano.com/journal"}},"__N_SSG":true}
