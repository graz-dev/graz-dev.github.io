{"pageProps":{"data":{"article":{"title":"2024 Wrapped: My Year as a DevRel Buddy","date":"2024-12-30"},"children":"<p>As December comes to a close, it’s time to reflect on the past year. Over a year and a half ago, I joined Mia-Platform, but it was only with the arrival of 2024 that I fully embraced my role as a DevRel buddy, working closely with my colleague Michel Murabito.</p>\n<h3>Sharing Knowledge: A Community-Driven Journey</h3>\n<p>One of the highlights of this year was sharing knowledge with the community. I had the privilege of participating as a speaker in 13 events, including online and in-person conferences across Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, England, and even California. Along the way, I met incredible individuals who left a lasting impression on me—people like Eric D. Schabell, with whom I shared the stage in Amsterdam, and Fernando Harris, who hosted me twice in his community in Malaga.</p>\n<p>I also had the honor of being a guest on one of my favorite podcasts, Gitbar Podcast, joining Mauro Murru, Michel Murabito, and Luca Rainone for a memorable conversation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I ventured into workshops this year, a new and exciting format for me. This experience was capped by an interview with the remarkable Jennifer Riggins, a writer whose insights and kindness make her a standout in our field.</p>\n<h3>Creating Content: Articles and More</h3>\n<p>This year wasn’t just about public speaking. I managed to publish several articles, including a collaborative piece with Davide Bianchi for InfoQ’s blog and a series of posts on my personal blog (you can find the link in the first comment!). Writing has been an excellent outlet to dive deeper into topics I’m passionate about and to share those insights with a wider audience.</p>\n<h3>Empowering Through Training</h3>\n<p>Internally, my efforts extended to creating training courses and certification programs focused on the technologies we work with at Mia-Platform. These sessions were attended by over 150 participants throughout the year, underscoring the importance of continuous learning and skill-building within our community.</p>\n<h3>Looking Ahead: #MiaPlatformExperts</h3>\n<p>One of the year’s most exciting achievements was laying the groundwork for the #MiaPlatformExperts community. Behind the scenes, I contributed to making our hackathons and monthly events truly memorable for our Experts. Next year promises even more exciting initiatives, so stay tuned!</p>\n<h3>Reflections and Goals</h3>\n<p>Reflecting on this year, I’m proud of the strides I’ve made in my first full year as a DevRel professional. Looking ahead to 2025, I’ve set two key goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consistency: Continuing to produce high-quality content, from talks and articles to workshops and training courses.</li>\n<li>Participation: Becoming more deeply involved in the Cloud Native and Open Source communities, engaging with CNCF working groups, and pushing myself to collaborate more, while keeping imposter syndrome in check.\nHere’s to another year of growth, collaboration, and new opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n","pageTitle":"2024 Wrapped: My Year as a DevRel Buddy - by Graziano Casto","pageDescription":"2024 Wrapped: My Year as a DevRel Buddy - by Graziano Casto","pageLink":"https://castograziano.com/articles/2024-wrapped-my-year-as-devrel-buddy","pageImage":"https://castograziano.com/casto_graziano_personal_website.png"},"schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"2024 Wrapped: My Year as a DevRel Buddy","datePublished":"2024-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2024-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Graziano Casto","url":"https://castograziano.com/about-me"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
