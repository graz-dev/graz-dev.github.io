With powerful language models (LLMs) and the growing availability of smaller, more accessible models (SLMs), we are entering a new phase of development where intelligent agents play a central role. Just like we once moved from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, we are now moving toward a model where software is built around interactions between AI agents. In this new approach, APIs are essential. They are how agents connect to the outside world, talk to each other, and work with existing systems. In this talk, we‚Äôll look at how to design software based on agent interactions, with a special focus on how APIs make this possible. We‚Äôll explore how generative models can power agents that use APIs, expose APIs, and coordinate tasks through APIs. You‚Äôll also learn practical patterns for building systems where multiple agents collaborate effectively using clear and well-defined interfaces.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6nOZE7EygrueQCgjto4PuevcWlo-5uN/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"DevFest Milano","event_url":"","place":"üáÆüáπ Milan","date":"2025-10-11","date_label":"October 11, 2025","talk_title":"Can an AI Agent Give a Talk? Let's Find the Speaker in the Room!","description":"Get ready for a provocative and engaging session that challenges the very notion of who, or what, can deliver a compelling presentation! In this talk, an AI agent will be built right before your eyes. Using the Google ADK framework and Gemini, this agent will scour the internet, prepare a presentation, and then deliver it. But here's where it gets really interesting: by the end of the session, you, the audience, will choose the topic the AI agent has to talk about. This raises some fascinating questions: Can the information it presents be trusted? What does this mean for the future of knowledge and communication when an AI can 'speak' with authority? Join us to find out if an AI can truly become the speaker in the room!","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xL-3DRHTkLGJg45xKdU2dALnRTyOn_ER/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"Better Software","event_url":"","place":"üáÆüáπ Turin","date":"2025-10-03","date_label":"October 03, 2025","talk_title":"Another Cluster Bites the Dust‚Ä¶ E Va Bene Cos√¨!","description":"Perch√© mantenere acceso il tuo cluster quando non lo stai usando?

One of the most challenging aspects about green software is understanding where to start. Before delving into more complex things, a good starting point is to raise awareness of the hidden ‚Äòzombies‚Äô within our infrastructure and then proceed to eliminate them. In this session, we‚Äôll explore what green software is, its environmental and economic implications and how kube-green (an open source project listed in the CNCF landscape) immediately help us make our cloud infrastructures more sustainable.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkoKj52u0sxjWSz5Bl2oXw9Yxl6OpeRh/view?usp=drive_link"},{"event_name":"Conf42 Platform Engineering","event_url":"","place":"üõú Online","date":"2024-09-05","date_label":"September 05, 2024","talk_title":"Platform Engineering Untold Truths: Is It Just an Infrastructure Matter?","description":"The increasing complexity of software development presents significant risks and inefficiencies, especially for large enterprises.

In the traditional policy enforcement model, manual management leaves organizations vulnerable to inevitable breaches due to human error ‚Äì a matter of 'when,' not 'if.' Enter Policy-as-Code (PaC), a game-changing approach that leverages code to define and manage policies, transforming rules and conditions into actionable directives. By keeping policy definitions in source code control, whenever a change is made, it can be tested, validated, and then executed. The goal of PaC is not to detect policy violations but to prevent them. In this session we delve into the practical implementation of a Policy-as-Code strategy for your organization using R√∂nd and Open Policy Agent, two powerful open-source projects that could help you to redefine your security paradigm.","url":"https://youtu.be/zcWF3EYGlRM?si=BdMU8_rzFcATopvB","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjxHmHjTXkeY8gwbQAAJ1gaz1us2q2wX/view?usp=sharing"}]},"schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage","name":"Speaking Engagements - Graziano Casto","description":"Explore speaking engagements and talks by Graziano Casto","url":"https://castograziano.com/speaking"}},"__N_SSG":true}
