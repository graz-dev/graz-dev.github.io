Yet, for many of us in the trenches, the daily reality looks quite different. We find ourselves wrestling with an infrastructure model built on long-lived, static environments for development, testing, and staging. This old way of working has quietly become a massive drain on our resources, creating financial waste, operational headaches, and a growing list of security and environmental debts.</p>\n<p>This isn't just one problem; it's a vicious cycle. The friction in our daily operations directly fuels the financial, security, and environmental burdens. To break free, we need more than just a new tool; we need to fundamentally rethink how we provision, manage, and consume infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>The High Cost of 'Always-On'</h2>\n<p>The most obvious symptom of this broken model is the money it wastes. It's not a small number; research suggests a staggering <a href=\"https://42on.com/the-hidden-costs-of-cloud-waste-how-to-optimize-your-cloud-resources-and-reduce-environmental-impact/\">30-45% of all cloud spending is wasted on idle or over-provisioned resources</a>. This isn't surprising when you think about it. Our staging, UAT, and dev environments are built to handle peak loads, but they spend most of their lives (nights, weekends, holidays) doing absolutely nothing. This leads to an abysmal average CPU utilization of just 12-15%, a clear sign that something is deeply inefficient. This problem is made worse by \"cloud sprawl\", where new resources pop up uncontrolled, increasing costs, security holes, and complexity.</p>\n<p>This financial drain is a direct result of operational friction. Many of us are familiar with the \"ticket-driven\" culture: a developer needs an environment, so they file a ticket and wait. And wait. This manual, slow process creates bottlenecks that grind the entire development lifecycle to a halt. In a world of complex microservices, setting these environments up by hand isn't just slow; it's a recipe for errors. This model encourages us to keep these costly, complex environments running indefinitely, because tearing them down and rebuilding them is just too painful.</p>\n<p>This persistence creates a huge security risk. Over time, these static environments suffer from \"configuration drift.\" Manual tweaks, untracked updates, and inconsistent patching mean they no longer match production or even each other. They become, as one source aptly put it, a <a href=\"https://www.quali.com/glossary/ephemeral-environments/\">\"hive of duplicated data, exploitable vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations\"</a>. Each one is a persistent attack surface, a liability that only grows with time.</p>\n<h2>The Unseen Environmental Toll</h2>\n<p>The money we waste on idle resources is just the tip of the iceberg. Under the surface lies a massive, often ignored, environmental cost. Every idle virtual machine or database isn't just a line item on a bill; it's a physical server in a data center, burning electricity and pumping out CO2 for no reason. Data centers already consume about <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390569272_The_Environmental_Impact_of_Cloud_Computing_Sustainability_in_the_Cloud\">1% of the world's electricity</a>, and that number is only going up.</p>\n<p>To put this in perspective, a 2019 study found that training a single large AI model can produce the same carbon emissions as <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/02/20/the-unsung-mechanics-how-ai-and-cloud-integration-drive-the-engine-of-sustainability/\">more than 300 cross-country flights</a>. This is the energy cost of our digital world. Beyond emissions, there's e-waste from constant hardware upgrades and the immense amount of water used for cooling. While cloud providers are more efficient than on-premise data centers, the core problem remains: we, the customers, are provisioning resources that sit idle, driving unnecessary environmental impact.</p>\n<p>Let's make this real. Imagine a team of 10 engineers with a single, static staging environment. It runs 24/7, but they only use it for about 160 hours a month. For the other 560 hours, nearly 78% of the time, it's idle but still racking up costs. Using the CO2 calculator from the <a href=\"https://kube-green.dev/\">kube-green project</a>, which assumes that a single pod produces about <a href=\"https://kube-green.dev/docs/FAQ/#how-much-co2-is-produced-by-a-pod\">11 kg of CO2eq per year</a>, we can see the impact. If that staging environment runs 20 pods, it generates 220 kg of CO2eq annually. By simply shutting it down when it's idle, the team could prevent over 170 kg of CO2eq emissions. Now, scale that across an entire organization. The waste is enormous.</p>\n<h2>The Ephemeral Revolution</h2>\n<p>This is where a new idea comes in: the ephemeral environment. It’s a complete shift in thinking. Instead of permanent, long-lived infrastructure, we move to on-demand, temporary workspaces that directly combat waste and friction. An ephemeral environment is a short-lived, isolated, and complete copy of your application, spun up for a specific task and automatically destroyed when you're done.</p>\n<p>This approach is built on a few key ideas. First, it's <strong>on-demand and automated</strong>. Environments are created by events in your workflow, like opening a pull request, not by filing a ticket. What once took days now takes minutes. Second, each environment is <strong>completely isolated</strong>. This means no more \"who broke the staging server?\" A developer can test a new feature, run a database migration, or experiment with a dependency without affecting anyone else. This enables true parallel development.</p>\n<p>Crucially, these are not just simple \"preview environments\". A true ephemeral environment achieves <strong>production-parity</strong>. It’s a full-fidelity clone of your production stack: backend services, databases, configurations, everything. This is how you kill the \"it works on my machine\" problem for good. Finally, these environments are both <strong>shareable and disposable</strong>. You get a unique URL to share with stakeholders for feedback on a live, running feature. When the pull request is merged, the entire environment is wiped away as if it never existed. This disposable nature is the key to its efficiency.</p>\n<p>Adopting this model has a transformative impact. It dramatically boosts developer velocity by removing bottlenecks. Some organizations have seen <a href=\"https://ephemeralenvironments.io/\">delivery times improve by up to 35%</a> and overall velocity increase by as much as 10x. It fosters better collaboration because everyone, from product managers to QA, can interact with a tangible, running feature, not just mockups. This \"shift-left\" approach to testing also means you catch bugs earlier, significantly improving code quality and reducing the risk of production failures. The old static staging environment is a relic of an old era: costly, slow, and risky. The ephemeral model is its opposite: on-demand, fast, safe, and efficient.</p>\n<h2>The Technology Pillars: Crossplane and kube-green</h2>\n<p>This vision of a fully ephemeral cloud requires the right technology. You need to be able to programmatically control not just your application containers, but the entire infrastructure ecosystem: databases, networks, storage, and more. This is where two key open-source projects come into play: Crossplane and kube-green.</p>\n<p>Crossplane is the heart of this architecture. It’s a universal control plane that extends the Kubernetes API to manage any cloud resource, not just containers. This represents a profound shift from traditional <a href=\"https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-infrastructure-as-code\">Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</a> tools like Terraform to a new model: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@swarupdonepudi/infrastructure-as-data-iad-coincidence-2ca6c70f896e\">Infrastructure as Data (IaD)</a>.</p>\n<p>With traditional IaC, you run a command like terraform apply to make a one-time change. With Crossplane, you declare the desired state of your infrastructure in a YAML file and submit it to the Kubernetes API. From then on, Crossplane's controllers work continuously to ensure reality matches your declaration. If anything drifts, Crossplane automatically corrects it. This \"self-healing\" capability is a game-changer.</p>\n<p>It works through a clever, layered architecture. <strong>Providers</strong> teach Crossplane how to talk to a specific API, like AWS or GCP. <strong>Managed Resources</strong> are the building blocks, representing a single piece of infrastructure like an S3 bucket or an RDS database. But the real magic is in <strong>Compositions</strong>. A platform team can use a Composition to bundle all the necessary Managed Resources into a single, high-level abstraction, like a PostgreSQLInstance. This blueprint can embed all the company's best practices for security, networking, and compliance.</p>\n<p>Developers don't need to worry about that complexity. They simply request what they need by creating a <strong>Claim</strong>: a simple YAML asking for a PostgreSQLInstance for example. Crossplane sees the claim and provisions the entire, production-ready stack automatically. This is true developer self-service, and it's exactly what's needed for ephemeral environments. When a pull request is opened, a CI/CD pipeline can create a single Claim that tells Crossplane to spin up a dedicated database, message queue, and everything else the application needs. When the PR is closed, deleting that one Claim tears it all down.</p>\n<p>While Crossplane manages the existence of the environment, <a href=\"https://kube-green.dev/\">kube-green</a> handles the efficiency within that existence. An ephemeral environment might live for a few days, but developers aren't working on it 24/7. kube-green is a simple, brilliant utility that solves this \"last mile\" problem by automatically hibernating resources on a schedule.</p>\n<p>It operates as a Kubernetes operator that you configure with a <strong>SleepInfo</strong> resource in each namespace. You can tell it to shut things down at 8 PM on weekdays and wake them up at 8 AM, for example. When the sleep time hits, kube-green scales down your Deployments and suspends your CronJobs. When the wake-up time arrives, it brings everything back to its original state. This simple action can lead to huge savings. Adopters have reported <a href=\"https://kube-green.dev/docs/adopters/\">30-40% reductions in cloud costs</a> for non-production clusters. And because it reduces energy consumption, it has a direct, positive impact on your carbon footprint.</p>\n<h2>The Synthesis: A New Blueprint for Efficiency</h2>\n<p>When you combine Crossplane's strategic, full-stack orchestration with kube-green's tactical, time-based optimization, you get something truly powerful. This synergy creates a multi-layered system of efficiency that aligns your infrastructure cost and carbon footprint with the actual, value-generating work of your development teams.</p>\n<p>The workflow, driven by GitOps tools like ArgoCD, is beautifully simple. A developer opens a pull request. This triggers a CI pipeline that generates the manifests for the new environment, including a Crossplane Claim for the infrastructure and a kube-green SleepInfo for the schedule. These manifests are committed to a Git repository. ArgoCD sees the new files and applies them to your management cluster. Crossplane springs into action, provisioning the entire infrastructure stack, perhaps in a lightweight vCluster for perfect isolation. Once the infrastructure is ready, ArgoCD deploys the application code. When the PR is merged or closed, a CI job removes the manifests from Git, and the entire environment vanishes.</p>\n<p>This creates a two-tiered optimization model. <strong>Macro-optimization</strong> from Crossplane ensures you only pay for infrastructure for the few days a PR is active, not for a permanent staging environment. <strong>Micro-optimization</strong> from kube-green then eliminates waste within that short lifespan by hibernating resources during non-working hours.</p>\n<p>This points to an exciting point: a \"deep sleep\" model. Using kube-green's ability to patch any Kubernetes resource, you could have it not only scale down pods but also patch the Crossplane Claim itself, for example, telling it to scale a database cluster down to a single, low-cost node overnight. This would extend time-based optimization to the entire stateful infrastructure stack, achieving the ultimate form of on-demand efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started on Your Journey</h2>\n<p>While this vision of a fully automated, per-PR ephemeral world is the goal, you don't have to build it all at once. The journey can start with a single, high-impact step. To make these concepts tangible, I've put together a <a href=\"https://github.com/graz-dev/crossplane-ephemeral-environments\">hands-on tutorial</a> that focuses on a pragmatic starting point: creating on-demand infrastructure that's only active when you need it.</p>\n<p>The tutorial walks you through using Crossplane to provision an AWS EKS cluster and then using kube-green to put it on a sleep/wake schedule. It's a direct, practical way to tackle the biggest source of waste: idle resources.</p>\n<p>If this vision for a more efficient cloud resonates with you, the best way to understand it is to build it. I invite you to check out the tutorial, <a href=\"https://github.com/graz-dev/crossplane-ephemeral-environments\">Ephemeral Cloud Resources with Crossplane and kube-green</a>.

It allows us to move from passively managing static resources to actively orchestrating dynamic, value-generating capabilities. The future of this model is even more exciting, driven by AI-powered optimization and the formalization of GreenOps.</p>\n<p>New AI tools like StormForge and CAST AI are emerging that can analyze workloads to automatically tune resource configurations and predict demand. Imagine an AI that could predict a PR's review cycle to allocate resources more intelligently or manage energy use based on the real-time carbon intensity of the power grid.</p>\n<p>This model is also a foundational practice for GreenOps, the discipline of bringing environmental accountability to cloud operations. As sustainability becomes a key business metric, the ability to measure and minimize the carbon footprint of software development will be a major differentiator.</p>\n<p>For technology leaders, the path forward is clear. Treat your internal infrastructure as a product and invest in a platform team to build out this capability. Foster a culture of accountability by making cost and carbon data transparent to your engineering teams. And start small. Pick a single service and use it as a pilot project to prove the value and build expertise.</p>\n<p>The combination of Crossplane and kube-green offers a powerful and pragmatic toolkit to begin this journey. By adopting this new blueprint, you can accelerate innovation while dramatically reducing your financial and environmental costs.</p>\n","pageTitle":"The Ephemeral Cloud: A New Blueprint for Infrastructure Efficiency With Crossplane and kube-green - by Graziano Casto","pageDescription":"The Ephemeral Cloud: A New Blueprint for Infrastructure Efficiency With Crossplane and kube-green - by Graziano Casto","pageLink":"https://castograziano.com/articles/ephemetal-cloud-with-crossplane-and-kubegreen","pageImage":"https://castograziano.com/casto_graziano_personal_website.png"},"schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"The Ephemeral Cloud: A New Blueprint for Infrastructure Efficiency With Crossplane and kube-green","datePublished":"2025-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","dateModified":"2025-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Graziano Casto","url":"https://castograziano.com/about-me"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
