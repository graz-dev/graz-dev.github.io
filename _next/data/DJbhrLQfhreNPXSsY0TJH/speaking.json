With powerful language models (LLMs) and the growing availability of smaller, more accessible models (SLMs), we are entering a new phase of development where intelligent agents play a central role. Just like we once moved from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, we are now moving toward a model where software is built around interactions between AI agents. In this new approach, APIs are essential. They are how agents connect to the outside world, talk to each other, and work with existing systems. In this talk, we’ll look at how to design software based on agent interactions, with a special focus on how APIs make this possible. We’ll explore how generative models can power agents that use APIs, expose APIs, and coordinate tasks through APIs. You’ll also learn practical patterns for building systems where multiple agents collaborate effectively using clear and well-defined interfaces.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6nOZE7EygrueQCgjto4PuevcWlo-5uN/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"DevFest Milano","event_url":"","place":"🇮🇹 Milan","date":"2025-10-11","date_label":"October 11, 2025","talk_title":"Can an AI Agent Give a Talk? Let's Find the Speaker in the Room!","description":"Get ready for a provocative and engaging session that challenges the very notion of who, or what, can deliver a compelling presentation! In this talk, an AI agent will be built right before your eyes. Using the Google ADK framework and Gemini, this agent will scour the internet, prepare a presentation, and then deliver it. But here's where it gets really interesting: by the end of the session, you, the audience, will choose the topic the AI agent has to talk about. This raises some fascinating questions: Can the information it presents be trusted? What does this mean for the future of knowledge and communication when an AI can 'speak' with authority? Join us to find out if an AI can truly become the speaker in the room!","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xL-3DRHTkLGJg45xKdU2dALnRTyOn_ER/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"Better Software","event_url":"","place":"🇮🇹 Turin","date":"2025-10-03","date_label":"October 03, 2025","talk_title":"Another Cluster Bites the Dust… E Va Bene Così!","description":"Perché mantenere acceso il tuo cluster quando non lo stai usando? Fai in modo che si spenga ogni notte! Con Crossplane e kube-green, puoi creare ephemeral environments che si attivano quando lavori e si spengono quando ti riposi. Immagina una configurazione che faccia il provisioning dinamico di un’infrastruttura complessa per i test, per poi spegnersi automaticamente durante le ore non lavorative come durante la notte o nei fine settimana. In questo talk, ti mostreremo come un IDP (Internal Developer Platform) può aiutare ad orchestrare in modo intelligente e on-demand la tua infrastruttura, in modo che gli sviluppatori possano concentrarsi sul creare applicazioni e non sul fare da babysitter ai cluster. Vedrai come funziona l’integrazione, esplorerai l’impatto su costi, efficienza e sostenibilità e scoprirai come passare da un infrastruttura statica a una dinamica ed eco-friendly.

Imagine a development setup that dynamically provisions complex infrastructure for testing, then automatically scales down during off-hours – like nights and weekends. In this talk, we’ll show you how Platform Engineering can orchestrate this smart, on-demand model, so developers can focus on building applications, not babysitting clusters.

Through a joint demo by Mia-Platform and ConfidentialMind, we’ll demonstrate how a GPU-powered cluster hosts both the ConfidentialMind Control Plane and the AI models, while the Mia-Platform Console serves as the unified entry point for developers. We’ll walk through the creation of a multi-tool agent built from templates available on the Mia-Platform Marketplace and powered by models deployed using the ConfidentialMind Control Plane. This agent interacts with our data to act as a shopping assistant for customers, providing product recommendations, stock availability, and suggestions for the nearest store based on the user’s location.

One of the most challenging aspects about green software is understanding where to start. Before delving into more complex things, a good starting point is to raise awareness of the hidden ‘zombies’ within our infrastructure and then proceed to eliminate them. In this session, we’ll explore what green software is, its environmental and economic implications and how kube-green (an open source project listed in the CNCF landscape) immediately help us make our cloud infrastructures more sustainable.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkoKj52u0sxjWSz5Bl2oXw9Yxl6OpeRh/view?usp=drive_link"},{"event_name":"Conf42 Platform Engineering","event_url":"","place":"🛜 Online","date":"2024-09-05","date_label":"September 05, 2024","talk_title":"Platform Engineering Untold Truths: Is It Just an Infrastructure Matter?","description":"The increasing complexity of software development presents significant risks and inefficiencies, especially for large enterprises.

In the traditional policy enforcement model, manual management leaves organizations vulnerable to inevitable breaches due to human error – a matter of 'when,' not 'if.' Enter Policy-as-Code (PaC), a game-changing approach that leverages code to define and manage policies, transforming rules and conditions into actionable directives. By keeping policy definitions in source code control, whenever a change is made, it can be tested, validated, and then executed. The goal of PaC is not to detect policy violations but to prevent them. In this session we delve into the practical implementation of a Policy-as-Code strategy for your organization using Rönd and Open Policy Agent, two powerful open-source projects that could help you to redefine your security paradigm.","url":"https://youtu.be/zcWF3EYGlRM?si=BdMU8_rzFcATopvB","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjxHmHjTXkeY8gwbQAAJ1gaz1us2q2wX/view?usp=sharing"}]},"schema":{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"WebPage","name":"Speaking Engagements - Graziano Casto","description":"Explore speaking engagements and talks by Graziano Casto","url":"https://castograziano.com/speaking"}},"__N_SSG":true}
