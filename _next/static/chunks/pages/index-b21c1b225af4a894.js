In the traditional policy enforcement model, manual management leaves organizations vulnerable to inevitable breaches due to human error – a matter of \'when,\' not \'if.\' Enter Policy-as-Code (PaC), a game-changing approach that leverages code to define and manage policies, transforming rules and conditions into actionable directives. By keeping policy definitions in source code control, whenever a change is made, it can be tested, validated, and then executed. The goal of PaC is not to detect policy violations but to prevent them. In this session we delve into the practical implementation of a Policy-as-Code strategy for your organization using R\xf6nd and Open Policy Agent, two powerful open-source projects that could help you to redefine your security paradigm.","url":"https://youtu.be/zcWF3EYGlRM?si=BdMU8_rzFcATopvB","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjxHmHjTXkeY8gwbQAAJ1gaz1us2q2wX/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"Digital Platform Builders","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/digital-platform-builders/events/","place":"\uD83D\uDEDC Online","date":"2024-06-26","date_label":"June 26, 2024","talk_title":"Platform Engineering untold truths: is it just an infrastructure matter?","description":"The increasing complexity of software development presents significant risks and inefficiencies, especially for large enterprises.

One of the most challenging aspects about green software is understanding where to start. Before delving into more complex things, a good starting point is to raise awareness of the hidden ‘zombies’ within our infrastructure and then proceed to eliminate them.
