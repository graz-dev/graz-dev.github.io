However, mere knowledge of the ‘what’ is often not enough; the most curious among us have often asked about the ‘how’: how do I begin my journey into the world of digital platforms? Well, if you have ever found yourself hitting a wall when trying to understand how to start your journey in adopting a digital platform, you have found the workshop that suits you! In this interactive workshop, using a Platform Journey Map, we will play the role of a Solution Architect who has to guide real companies through their platform adoption journey. Yes, you heard that right, we will be playing, because the journey is presented as a board game where the players, our fantastic Solution Architects, must conquer spaces to mature their platform. In this workshop, we won’t just talk about digital platforms as mere orchestrators of infrastructure, but there will also be room to discuss software lifecycle, architecture modernization, business composability, and market use cases.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QfYSxd9-ybR87d5zkE9jDiSgC88yEvxx/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"CloudX","event_url":"","place":"\uD83C\uDDFA\uD83C\uDDF8 Santa Clara, CA","date":"2024-11-06","date_label":"November 06, 2024","talk_title":"Challenges and Takeaways of Managing AI Workloads on Cloud","description":"In today’s technological landscape, the synergy between Cloud Native technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) opens the stage to a myriad of unexplored challenges and opportunities.

Yet this data can offer vital insights to sail smoothly. This session will explore strategies to avoid drowning, improving DevEx, and more. The cloud-native ecosystem has grown exponentially in the last few years, as has the complexity of the distributed architectures being built. In a context where keeping up with technology requires a substantial amount of computational power and data, monitoring our cloud-native applications has become a constant struggle against the storm. The ever-increasing volume of traces, metrics, events, and logs generated by our systems is a double-edged sword: on one hand, if not managed correctly, becoming a distraction from needed insights. On the other hand, if approached with care and thought, providing organizations the chance to sail calm cloud-native seas. In this session, we will discover how to avoid drowning in the sea of monitoring data, instead understanding how to provide insights while using only what is needed. We will explore the emerging scenarios on the horizon, abandoning the oars and testing the waters of artificial intelligence as it applies to our observability use cases. We will discuss how to leverage monitoring data, conversational DevEx, and anomaly prediction, among other topics, in this talk.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BBOJOlqXru6LGhWMVKVnJwRxcdmHfjcO/view?usp=drive_link"},{"event_name":"Conf42 DevSecOps","event_url":"","place":"\uD83D\uDEDC Online","date":"2024-12-05","date_label":"December 05, 2024","talk_title":"A Policy-as-Code Approach to RBAC Authorization","description":"The cloud-native landscape brings incredible advantages, but it also introduces new security challenges, making safeguarding a top priority.

Create Your FaaS Platform Using WASM","description":"As the technology landscape evolves and the need for adaptability to solve modern problems grows, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) has emerged as a pivotal strategy to meet the elasticity demands of today’s systems. However, a pressing question remains: how can we make our functions truly portable, with minimal overhead, while achieving the high level of dynamism promised by FaaS? The answer already exists, and you don’t need the Infinity Gems to make it happen. All you need is wasmCloud, a CNCF incubating project, and a few tips to take the right path in building your own FaaS platform using WebAssembly (WASM).

In this talk, we’ll explore how Kubernetes can serve as a “compass”, guiding workloads across space and time to optimize energy efficiency. By leveraging temporal shifting to align workloads with periods of peak renewable energy generation and spatial shifting to dynamically move workloads to regions with surplus green energy, we’ll demonstrate strategies that not only reduce carbon footprints but also enhance cost-efficiency. Through real-world examples and practical insights, this session will showcase how temporal and spatial scheduling innovations can transform Kubernetes into a powerful tool for sustainable cloud operations. Join us to discover how to navigate the intersection of technology and sustainability, paving the way for a greener, smarter future.","url":"https://vimeo.com/1082499404?fl=pl&fe=sh","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j4hRrEFjBPyjD1Y4Xl8pMiIT4s3frKP4/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"Platmosphere","event_url":"","place":"\uD83C\uDDEE\uD83C\uDDF9 Milan","date":"2025-05-20","date_label":"May 20, 2025","talk_title":"How Platform Engineering Streamlines the End-to-End Delivery of a Self-Hosted Agentic Architecture","description":"In this session, we’ll explore how platform engineering enables the seamless delivery of an AI-powered agentic architecture—from deploying open-source models to building and releasing a simple agent that interacts with real-world applications. Through a joint demo by Mia-Platform and ConfidentialMind, we’ll demonstrate how a GPU-powered cluster hosts both the ConfidentialMind Control Plane and the AI models, while the Mia-Platform Console serves as the unified entry point for developers. We’ll walk through the creation of a multi-tool agent built from templates available on the Mia-Platform Marketplace and powered by models deployed using the ConfidentialMind Control Plane. This agent interacts with our data to act as a shopping assistant for customers, providing product recommendations, stock availability, and suggestions for the nearest store based on the user’s location.

With powerful language models (LLMs) and the growing availability of smaller, more accessible models (SLMs), we are entering a new phase of development where intelligent agents play a central role. Just like we once moved from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, we are now moving toward a model where software is built around interactions between AI agents. In this new approach, APIs are essential. They are how agents connect to the outside world, talk to each other, and work with existing systems. In this talk, we’ll look at how to design software based on agent interactions, with a special focus on how APIs make this possible. We’ll explore how generative models can power agents that use APIs, expose APIs, and coordinate tasks through APIs. You’ll also learn practical patterns for building systems where multiple agents collaborate effectively using clear and well-defined interfaces.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6nOZE7EygrueQCgjto4PuevcWlo-5uN/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"KCD Porto","event_url":"https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-porto-presents-kcd-porto-2025/","place":"\uD83C\uDDF5\uD83C\uDDF9 Porto","date":"2025-11-03","date_label":"November 3, 2025","talk_title":"Serving LLMs on Kubernetes: A Golden Path for Platform Engineers","description":"Explore how to efficiently serve Large Language Models on Kubernetes clusters, covering resource optimization, scaling strategies, and best practices for platform engineers managing AI workloads in production environments.","url":"","slides":""},{"event_name":"Container Day","event_url":"https://www.containerday.it/talk/the-kubernetes-compass-come-navigare-spazio-e-tempo-per-essere-piu-sostenibili/?_gl=1*9vcxdj*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU3OTMxMzgxNS4xNzUzMTE5Mzk4*_ga_GH3N0VLD75*czE3NTMxMTkzOTUkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTMxMTkzOTUkajYwJGwwJGgw","place":"\uD83C\uDDEE\uD83C\uDDF9 Bologna","date":"2025-11-05","date_label":"November 5, 2025","talk_title":"The Kubernetes Compass: Navigating Space and Time for Energy Efficiency","description":"Learn advanced techniques for optimizing Kubernetes clusters for energy efficiency, including intelligent scheduling, resource management, and sustainable cloud-native practices that reduce environmental impact while maintaining performance.","url":"","slides":""},{"event_name":"Kubecon NA -
