With powerful language models (LLMs) and the growing availability of smaller, more accessible models (SLMs), we are entering a new phase of development where intelligent agents play a central role. Just like we once moved from procedural programming to object-oriented programming, we are now moving toward a model where software is built around interactions between AI agents. In this new approach, APIs are essential. They are how agents connect to the outside world, talk to each other, and work with existing systems. In this talk, we’ll look at how to design software based on agent interactions, with a special focus on how APIs make this possible. We’ll explore how generative models can power agents that use APIs, expose APIs, and coordinate tasks through APIs. You’ll also learn practical patterns for building systems where multiple agents collaborate effectively using clear and well-defined interfaces.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G6nOZE7EygrueQCgjto4PuevcWlo-5uN/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"DevFest Milano","event_url":"","place":"🇮🇹 Milan","date":"2025-10-11","date_label":"October 11, 2025","talk_title":"Can an AI Agent Give a Talk? Let's Find the Speaker in the Room!","description":"Get ready for a provocative and engaging session that challenges the very notion of who, or what, can deliver a compelling presentation! In this talk, an AI agent will be built right before your eyes. Using the Google ADK framework and Gemini, this agent will scour the internet, prepare a presentation, and then deliver it. But here's where it gets really interesting: by the end of the session, you, the audience, will choose the topic the AI agent has to talk about. This raises some fascinating questions: Can the information it presents be trusted? What does this mean for the future of knowledge and communication when an AI can 'speak' with authority? Join us to find out if an AI can truly become the speaker in the room!","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xL-3DRHTkLGJg45xKdU2dALnRTyOn_ER/view?usp=sharing"},{"event_name":"Better Software","event_url":"","place":"🇮🇹 Turin","date":"2025-10-03","date_label":"October 03, 2025","talk_title":"Another Cluster Bites the Dust… E Va Bene Così!","description":"Perché mantenere acceso il tuo cluster quando non lo stai usando?

Immagina una configurazione che faccia il provisioning dinamico di un’infrastruttura complessa per i test, per poi spegnersi automaticamente durante le ore non lavorative come durante la notte o nei fine settimana. In questo talk, ti mostreremo come un IDP (Internal Developer Platform) può aiutare ad orchestrare in modo intelligente e on-demand la tua infrastruttura, in modo che gli sviluppatori possano concentrarsi sul creare applicazioni e non sul fare da babysitter ai cluster. Vedrai come funziona l’integrazione, esplorerai l’impatto su costi, efficienza e sostenibilità e scoprirai come passare da un infrastruttura statica a una dinamica ed eco-friendly.

Let it bite the dust, every night, and that’s just fine. With Crossplane and kube-green, you can unlock ephemeral environments that spin up when you code and shut down when you rest. Imagine a development setup that dynamically provisions complex infrastructure for testing, then automatically scales down during off-hours – like nights and weekends. In this talk, we’ll show you how Platform Engineering can orchestrate this smart, on-demand model, so developers can focus on building applications, not babysitting clusters. You’ll see the integration in action, explore the impact on cost, efficiency, and sustainability, and discover how to shift from static uptime to dynamic, eco-friendly infrastructure.

Through a joint demo by Mia-Platform and ConfidentialMind, we’ll demonstrate how a GPU-powered cluster hosts both the ConfidentialMind Control Plane and the AI models, while the Mia-Platform Console serves as the unified entry point for developers. We’ll walk through the creation of a multi-tool agent built from templates available on the Mia-Platform Marketplace and powered by models deployed using the ConfidentialMind Control Plane. This agent interacts with our data to act as a shopping assistant for customers, providing product recommendations, stock availability, and suggestions for the nearest store based on the user’s location.

In this talk, we’ll explore how Kubernetes can serve as a “compass”, guiding workloads across space and time to optimize energy efficiency. By leveraging temporal shifting to align workloads with periods of peak renewable energy generation and spatial shifting to dynamically move workloads to regions with surplus green energy, we’ll demonstrate strategies that not only reduce carbon footprints but also enhance cost-efficiency. Through real-world examples and practical insights, this session will showcase how temporal and spatial scheduling innovations can transform Kubernetes into a powerful tool for sustainable cloud operations.

Yet this data can offer vital insights to sail smoothly. This session will explore strategies to avoid drowning, improving DevEx, and more. The cloud-native ecosystem has grown exponentially in the last few years, as has the complexity of the distributed architectures being built. In a context where keeping up with technology requires a substantial amount of computational power and data, monitoring our cloud-native applications has become a constant struggle against the storm. The ever-increasing volume of traces, metrics, events, and logs generated by our systems is a double-edged sword: on one hand, if not managed correctly, becoming a distraction from needed insights. On the other hand, if approached with care and thought, providing organizations the chance to sail calm cloud-native seas. In this session, we will discover how to avoid drowning in the sea of monitoring data, instead understanding how to provide insights while using only what is needed. We will explore the emerging scenarios on the horizon, abandoning the oars and testing the waters of artificial intelligence as it applies to our observability use cases. We will discuss how to leverage monitoring data, conversational DevEx, and anomaly prediction, among other topics, in this talk.","url":"","slides":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BBOJOlqXru6LGhWMVKVnJwRxcdmHfjcO/view?usp=drive_link"},{"event_name":"CloudX","event_url":"","place":"🇺🇸 Santa Clara, CA","date":"2024-11-06","date_label":"November 06, 2024","talk_title":"Challenges and Takeaways of Managing AI Workloads on Cloud","description":"In today’s technological landscape, the synergy between Cloud Native technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) opens the stage to a myriad of unexplored challenges and opportunities.

Well, if you have ever found yourself hitting a wall when trying to understand how to start your journey in adopting a digital platform, you have found the workshop that suits you! In this interactive workshop, using a Platform Journey Map, we will play the role of a Solution Architect who has to guide real companies through their platform adoption journey. Yes, you heard that right, we will be playing, because the journey is presented as a board game where the players, our fantastic Solution Architects, must conquer spaces to mature their platform.
